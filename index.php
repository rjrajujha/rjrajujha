                    <p class="lead">
                        As a software developer, I specialize in JavaScript with a focus on Node.js and its associated frameworks and libraries such as Express.js, React.js, and Next.js. I also have proficiency in Python, primarily for solving algorithmic challenges and data structures. Although my expertise lies in backend and frontend development, I also possess a working knowledge of PHP.

                    <p>
                        Throughout my career, I've gained valuable experience working with various databases, including MongoDB and MySQL. I'm passionate about creating efficient and scalable solutions, and I thrive in dynamic and collaborative environments where I can continuously learn and grow.
